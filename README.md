- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Nalz65
Being an employee for IEE has been joyous occasion for me.

I thought it wasn't possible to be in a world of vast information in regards to tech and innovation for MTN. 
I do pride myself in learning as it is the one thing that will never end as I do enjoy lot's of it. I do have a broad set of skills, 
ranging from OS systems like Linux and Windows, to containerized systems like Docker and Kubernetes, and VM technology like VMWare VSphere. H
owever I do not intend to stop here.

I'd like to still broaden my horizons and meet new tech minded people who could possibly introduce me to other concepts within the IT space. 
Hence why I'm currently a part time student for Hyperion Dev learning Data Science and will also probably join a second course later in the year for 
Web Dev(So I can refresh my memory for web development) as well.

I do like to spend hours sitting in front of my powerfully built PC with either doing work or just learning something new. 
It is just fun to put myself in a position of new experiences in regards to IT.
